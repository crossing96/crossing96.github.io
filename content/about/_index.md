title: PubXel OncoTweet: Stay Updated with Cancer Research

---
## 🔍 Project Overview

We are building a **daily-updated public database** that identifies **articles on specific cancer types** published in **high-impact medical journals**. Select clinically relevant articles are summarized on **Twitter**, making it easier to stay informed. The project currently covers **7 major cancer types**.

## ❓ Why This Matters

Keeping up with cancer research is overwhelming. Take **breast cancer**, for example - important papers are scattered across journals of various fields, including oncology, radiation, surgery, general medicine, and biology. With **hundreds of journals** involved, it's nearly impossible to track everything.

In our internal survey:
- **71%** of clinicians/researchers lacked a reliable method to stay up to date.
- **86%** found the process **time-consuming**.

## ⚙️ Our Approach

We use a mix of automation and AI to solve this:

1. **Daily PubMed Crawling** using broad search terms.
2. **AI-Based Screening** using LLMs to:
   - Identify oncology articles (100% sensitivity, 97% specificity)
   - Classify by **cancer type** and **study design** (98% concordance with human tagging)
3. Articles are categorized and uploaded to a **public spreadsheet**.
