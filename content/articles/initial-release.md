Hi, I'm Jongyeob Kim of the Pub-Xel Team. We are thrilled to share with you the first component of **Pub-Xel project**: Pub-Xel App.

Our [team](https://pubxel.org/author/), all of us being both clinicians and researchers, has always strived to streamline access to new research, reduce the time needed to find relevant information, and improve efficiency in managing it. Over time, we realized that the challenge often lies not in a lack of information, but in its overwhelming abundance.

We wanted to develop practical and efficient methods to address these challenges and share them with our colleagues. Minimizing time spent on repetitive tasks is crucial, as it allows more time to focus on clinical care and research, ultimately enhancing their quality.

This is why we launched the Pub-Xel projectâ€”a free, open-source initiative designed to synergize with and enhance powerful existing platforms like PubMed and Microsoft Excel. The project consists of three key components:

1. **Pub-Xel OncoTwitter**: Screens PubMed every day for high-impact, recently published articles on topics of your interest using AI tools and expert input, delivering them directly via user-friendly platforms like X (formerly Twitter).

2. **Pub-Xel App**: Streamlines the management of biomedical literature on your computer.

3. Pub-Xel Chrome Extension (planned): Enhances PubMed searches with functionalities like publisher/impact factor filtering and PDF downloads. 

Currently, we are focusing on developing the MacOS version of Pub-Xel App, which is expected to be completed by April, while also stabilizing the Windows version. Next, we will shift our attention to the Chrome Extension, with the goal of publishing it on the Chrome Web Store by June. Simultaneously, we will run tests for Pub-Xel OncoTwitter in specific oncology topics, such as lung cancer and genitourinary cancers, and aim to launch the initial version no later than June.

Thank you for your interest in Pub-Xel project. We hope you find these tools as useful and enjoyable as we did while writing them. If you did, please consider sharing them with your friends and colleagues.
